ECE340X â€“ Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning for Engineering

This project was built for various homework assignments for ECE340X, B term 2023. Python code was developed with the end goal of testing different ML models on the CIFAR-10 dataset to see their accuracy for classification. It is important to note that this code was in part made through ChatGPT prompting, although it has been modified, labeled, and debugged by a human.
